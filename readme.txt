Adds lots of advanced options to control how you display the price for your WooCommerce variable products.

== Description ==

**Variation Price Display Range for WooCommerce** plugin lets you change the price displayed on both the shop page and the single product page. 

By default, variable products on WooCommerce display a range of prices from lowest to highest.

*For example,* the price on the product page might look something like $49 – $99. For a lot of online stores, this approach can be confusing for your shoppers.

Displaying just a range can make it difficult for customers to figure out what they’ll pay. Fortunately, you can change the price range for variable products in WooCommerce.

For example, instead of showing $49 - $99 for a variation product, you can show "From $49" , or "Upto $99"

WooCommerce Variation Price Display Range plugin helps you to show variations in a more user-friendly way. It allows you to adjust how your variation price ranges display to create a better WooCommerce store.

=== Excellent Features of this plugin ===

🥳 **Different variation price display formats**
The Variation Price Display plugin lets WooCommece store owners complete flexibility in displaying variable prices. 

🥳 **Display Highest or Maximum price**
You might want to display the maximum price instead of a price range. This plugin lets you display only the highest or maximum price for variable products.

🥳 **Display Lowest or Minimum Price**
This plugin also lets you show only the cheapest or lowest price in WooCommerce variable products, which means you can avoid the price separator.

🥳 **Show Maximum to Minimum Price**
Sometimes, the lowest price could be a sample price rather than the actual price. You can use this plugin to show the maximum to the minimum price in that scenario.

🥳 **Show Minimum to Maximum Price**
It's a default feature of WooCommece. Still, we have included it in our plugin settings so that you do not have to face any difficulty finding this feature.

🥳 **Show “From” before the minimum price**
Instead of the default price range separator, you can use wording like 'From $49'. Your customers will get a clear view of the product from it.

🥳 **Show “Up To” before the maximum price.**
This plugin can show the price, indicating that lower price options are also available. For example, you can show it as ‘Up to $99’. 

🥳 **Change price by selecting variation from the dropdown**
Instead of displaying a barely visible price somewhere below the description, it's better to update the main price with the selected variation’s price.

🥳 **Hide default variation price**
By default, WooCommerce displays product variation prices in a separator that lists the lowest to the highest price. However, the plugin lets you choose from different options. 

🥳 **Remove clear link**
WooCommerce Product Range Display plugin lets you hide or remove the clear link when you select a variation. Incase you want to show the clear button, you'll find the option on the plugin settings.

🥳 **Format Sale Price**
Display crossed regular pice beside the sale price. Attract your customer and let them know about this on-sale product.
